# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to buid a website that house notes on Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project taught me the fundamentals of basic coding software like VS Code, Github, and the terminal. Additionally, I learned how to work in the three coding languages. The creation of the project website built a function space to house my notes on the topics of the prework.

## Installation

I began by installing the basic HTML structue of my website. Next, I added new features to my website using CSS. Finally, I added JavaScript to help add functionality to the website.

## Usage

To use the prework study guide website, first begin by opening the html folder. Then, review the notes under the four different catagories: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. To add more notes, simply open up the source code in a code editng software and add the neccesary notes to the correct section in the body of the HTML.

## Credits

For this project I used instruction provided by KU Coding Bootcamp as well as VS Code and GitHub for writing and storing the code.
